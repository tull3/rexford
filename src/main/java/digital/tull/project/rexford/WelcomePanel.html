                    <h2>The Tull Project</h2>
                    <p>&emsp; Welcome to The Tull Project.  I am Tull, and this website is my project.  Its purpose is many-fold.  First, it is a testing platform for my work in the Java programming language, using different technologies like the Wicket framework, JDBC, and SQL.  Also, it serves as a living portfolio of that work and facilitates collaboration with others in this profession and the wider community.  Finally, it will be an outlet for my writing and help to manifest my desire to contribute to the technological and philosophical worlds which have contributed so much to me.  In a secondary capacity, "The Tull Project" also encompasses the servers and databases which support this platform.</p>
